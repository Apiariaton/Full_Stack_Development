**_Expenses_Tracker_** is a user interface via which a user can track their monthly expenses which are then plotted as a chart. The user may add expenses via the submission of a form.

 It explores several key concepts within React, including: <br/><br/>
-React states <br/><br/>
-Moving the State Up and Down <br/><br/>
-The use of props and the channelling of data from App.js downwards <br/><br/>
-The use of the map and filter functions to render content dynamically <br/><br/>
-The use of dynamic content styling <br/><br/>
-The use of JSX in events handling (buttons/form submission), conditional elements, computed states <br/><br/>
-Componentisation <br/><br/><br/>

It does this through a platform via which a user can track their monthly expenses which are then 
plotted as a chart. They may add expenses via the submission of a form.

**_Interest Table__** features the use of a dynamic table and error correction in a form.

__Login__ features the use of dynamic, deletable content, as well as the incorporation of a dialogue window via Material UI.


**_Food App_** enables the user to order items from a menu, such that their cart is updated. They may then access this cart via a dialogue window, and add or remove items as they wish. It features the use of the AuthContext / useContext, useEffect and useReducer hooks, as well as dynamic list generation.

**_Journal**_ is a React app which connects with Firebase's Realtime Database. It enables the user to submit journal
entries which are then mapped to individual journal entries on the same page, and features local data storage.
