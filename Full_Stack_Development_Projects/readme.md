_Expenses_Tracker_ explores several key concepts within React, including: <br/><br/>
-React states <br/><br/>
-Moving the State Up and Down <br/><br/>
-The use of props and the channelling of data from App.js downwards <br/><br/>
-The use of the map and filter functions to render content dynamically <br/><br/>
-The use of dynamic content styling <br/><br/>
-The use of JSX in events handling (buttons/form submission), conditional elements, computed states <br/><br/>
-Componentisation <br/><br/><br/><br/>

It does this through a platform via which a user can track their monthly expenses which are then 
plotted as a chart. They may add expenses via the submission of a form.
