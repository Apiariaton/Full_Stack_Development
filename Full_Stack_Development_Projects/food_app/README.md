This app uses a connection to Firebase to obtain a list of menu items. It then permits the user to choose which items they would like to order, by interacting with a UI panel. Once they have made their selection, they are presented with the total; by filling out a payment form, which includes a Postcode API to verify that the postcode is correct, they can then submit their order to Firebase.
