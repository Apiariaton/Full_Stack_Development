**CalculateScore** - _HighScore_ - how to incorporate Java classes within conditional logic </br></br>
               _Bonsai_   - exploration of Java classes with conditional logic </br></br>
               _MethodOverload_ - method overloading i.e. using a method with the same name + different parameters (order, number, type) to handle range of data inputs </br></br>
               _ConvertToCentimeters_ - method overloading in action </br></br>
               _PlayingCat_ - program with method that has a Boolean output </br></br> 
               _HoursMinutesSeconds_ - program to convert hours and seconds into hours, minutes, seconds, using conditional logic and method overloading </br></br>
               _Main_ - program to explore switch and enhanced statements</br></br>
               _Expansion_ - program to explore for loops in Java</br></br>
               _Input__ - using an instance, error handling and do while loops - obtaining input via scanner which is permitted via Java, whereas console() is disabled by IDEs</br></br>
               _BankAccount, MainBankAccount__ - exploration of the creation of new objects in Java; setting private attributes using private keyword; accessing their value using public (attributeDataType) method; setting their values using basic setter methods. This version does not yet have validation. These programs also explore constructors, means by which a new object can be instantiated. Like methods, a constructor may be overloaded, such that multiple methods exist with the same name but differing parameter signatures. It is advisable that the exhaustive constructor is called as the first line of any constructors with incomplete parameters, by using the this() keyword, followed by any values provided together with any default values. Values should be initialised in the exhaustive constructor by using the this.fieldname = value method, rather than any setter methods.</br></br>
