# Full_Stack_Development

This folder includes some of the smaller projects I have worked on while studying React and Node.

More recently, I have learned more about Github, as well as the use cases of React vs Redux; in the future, I would like to create individual repositories for each small project, with the view to deploying each via continuous development/integration.

In the future, it is my intention to return to the Order app to rework some of the code, such that it employs React Redux and SOLID principles.
