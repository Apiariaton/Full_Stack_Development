React_Refs facilitate the access of the DOM node whereby a React componenet is created. They enable the coder to access the value of the component with which the ref hook is associated.

React_Portals enable the coder to generate code from a specified DOM node, regardless of the component's location
within App or a similar component which may be generated from another DOM node.

React_Fragments permit the coder to not wrap elements within a div element.

Controlled refers to elements managed via useState, while uncontrolled refers to elements accessed via useRef.
