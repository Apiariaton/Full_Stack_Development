Javascript Refresher contains key Javascript functions and syntax; first-react-app implements a basic React app; first local-react-app implements the basic React folder structure.

basic_react_app_w_props_and_nesting showcases the basic principles of React: components, nested components and props.

state demonstrates some uses of the state concept in React, including the use of prevState and the organisation of state into individual state slices or a state object; it also explores the use of one input handler function to manage changes to multiple states effected by HTMl elements, and the use of a submitHandler to manage forms, as well as two-way binding to reset form fields to null after submitting a form.

Shopping_Lists explores updating a parent element's state from a child component, using a save data function which is used as a prop.
